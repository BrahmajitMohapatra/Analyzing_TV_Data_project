<p>The dataset we'll use was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">scraped</a> and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions">game data</a>, one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings">TV data</a>, and one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows">halftime musician data</a> for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018. Let's take a look, using <code>display()</code> instead of <code>print()</code> since its output is much prettier in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
